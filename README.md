# Neurodesk Builder

A container build system with support for dynamic Jinja2 templating and Starlark scripting.

## Features

- **Template System**: Jinja2-compatible templating for dynamic build configuration
- **Starlark Scripting**: Full programming language support for complex build logic
- **Modular Directives**: Composable build instructions with validation
- **Recipe System**: YAML-based build recipes with parameter support
- **Neurodocker Compatibility**: Designed to replace and extend neurodocker templates

## Jinja2 Subset (Behavior Notes)

The embedded Jinja2 engine intentionally implements a pragmatic subset of Jinja2 for stability:
- Undefined variables raise errors rather than rendering empty strings.
- Loop variables support a limited set (`loop.last`, basic indices).
- Whitespace trim tokens are parsed but not acted upon.

These differences are by design. If you rely on full Jinja2 behavior, consider simplifying templates or preâ€‘rendering with a full Jinja2 engine upstream.

## New: Starlark Scripting Support

This builder now supports Starlark scripts for dynamic container builds. Starlark provides a Python-like programming language that integrates seamlessly with the existing Jinja2 template system.

### Key Benefits

- **Dynamic Logic**: Make build decisions based on runtime conditions
- **Full Programming Language**: Conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures
- **Parameter Access**: Complete access to build parameters and context variables
- **Modular Functions**: Reusable and composable build logic
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear error messages and debugging capabilities

### Quick Example

```yaml
# build.yaml
name: my-app
version: "1.0.0"

build:
  kind: neurodocker
  base-image: "ubuntu:20.04"
  pkg-manager: apt

  directives:
    - variables:
        enable_gpu: true
        python_version: "3.9"

    - starlark:
        script: |
          # Access template variables
          version = context.version
          enable_gpu = context.enable_gpu
          py_version = context.python_version

          def setup_environment():
              # Install base packages
              install_packages("curl", "wget", "git")
              
              # Python installation
              if py_version == "3.9":
                  install_packages("python3.9", "python3.9-dev")
              else:
                  install_packages("python3", "python3-dev")
              
              # GPU support
              if enable_gpu:
                  install_packages("nvidia-cuda-toolkit")
                  set_environment("CUDA_ENABLED", "true")
              
              # Set up application
              set_environment("APP_VERSION", version)
              run_command("python3 --version")

          setup_environment()
```

### Available Functions

Starlark scripts have access to these built-in functions:

- `install_packages(pkg1, pkg2, ...)` - Install system packages
- `set_variable(name, value)` - Set variables for use in other directives
- `run_command(command)` - Execute shell commands
- `set_environment(key, value)` - Set environment variables
- `print(...)` - Debug output

### Context Variables

All template variables are available as attributes of the `context` and `local` objects in Starlark scripts:

- `context.version` - Package version
- `context.PackageManager` - Package manager (`apt`, `yum`, ...)
- `context.arch` - Target architecture (`x86_64`, `aarch64`)
- User-defined variables from the `variables` directive (e.g., `context.my_variable`)
- Variables set by previous directives

The `context` and `local` objects provide the same variables - they are aliases for convenience.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `build.yaml` file with your build configuration
2. Use traditional directives or Starlark scripts for complex logic
3. Build your container using the builder CLI

See the [examples/](examples/) directory for more comprehensive examples.

## Unprivileged BuildKit Builder Image

A Dockerfile is provided to package this builder together with BuildKit and Apptainer for unprivileged builds (no host Docker daemon required).

- Base image: `moby/buildkit:latest`
- Installs: `apptainer`, `bash`, and the `builder` CLI
- Helper: `sf-make` script to stage, build via BuildKit, and optionally emit a SIF
- Published to: `ghcr.io/neurodesk/builder:latest`

Quick usage:

1) Pull the published image (or build locally)
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/neurodesk/builder:latest
   # Or build locally:
   # docker build -t neurodesk/builder:latest -f Dockerfile .
   ```

2) Run and build a recipe to a SIF
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it \
     -v "$PWD":/work \
     --privileged=false \
     ghcr.io/neurodesk/builder:latest \
     sf-make --config builder.config.yaml path/to/recipe
   ```

The `sf-make` command:
- Generates the Dockerfile and build context using this repo's CLI (`builder stage`)
- Starts a rootless `buildkitd` inside the container and builds with `buildctl`
- Produces a `docker-archive` tar and, by default, a SIF under `sifs/`

**Note**: The image expects a mounted volume at `/work` containing your neurocontainers repository with recipes and configuration.

## Large Files and HTTP Caching

- Files referenced by recipes (local or remote) are handled via streaming I/O to avoid loading large blobs into memory.
- Remote downloads use a persistent cache with ETag/Last-Modified validation to avoid repeated long downloads.
- Default cache directory: `local/httpcache`. Override with `BUILDER_HTTP_CACHE_DIR`.
- Build staging for `get_file()` uses `local/build/<recipe>/cache` and copies files from the persistent cache when available.

## Examples

- [Starlark Usage Guide](examples/starlark_usage.md) - Comprehensive examples and best practices
- [Simple Demo](examples/starlark-demo.yaml) - Basic Starlark functionality demonstration

## Architecture

- `pkg/jinja2/` - Jinja2-compatible template engine
- `pkg/starlark/` - Starlark scripting support and value conversion
- `pkg/recipe/` - Build recipe system with directive validation
- `pkg/ir/` - Intermediate representation for build instructions
- `pkg/templates/` - Traditional neurodocker-style templates

## Migration from Neurodocker

The Starlark scripting system is designed to replace traditional neurodocker templates while providing much more flexibility and power. See the [Starlark Usage Guide](examples/starlark_usage.md) for migration examples.
